# Here we present the code used for the replication of the Portugues et al
# 2011 paper, as presented in [cit. stytra].
# The protocol defined presents the fish with white and black gratings
#  moving backward with repect to the fish. When the fish swims they are
# dragged forward according to the estimated fish velocity, in a closed loop
# configuration. This is implemented in the ClosedLoop1DGratings class. The
# gain that converts the tail sdisplacement to grating movements is modified
# every three grating movements. Gain 1 means normal velocity (around 20 mm/s
#  maximum in a bout). Gains 0.5 and 1.5 are defined accordingly.

# Running this script on a setup configured according to the stytra
# configuration should allow for the replication of the same experimental
# conditions.
